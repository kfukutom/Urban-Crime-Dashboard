# Project Overview

This project is my journey in learning **React Native**, **HTML/CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a strong focus on creating an intuitive and efficient user experience. Key goals of this project include:

- Establishing a clear **Design Hierarchy** for intuitive navigation
- Enhancing **User Interface (UI) Experience** for seamless interaction
- Deploying a productive **Agent-Based Model** to simulate a crime-related environment
- Blend passion for products that connect tangible and intangible, digital spaces.
- Learn D3.js / front-end stuff

## Current Progress

As of **October 29, 2024**, I have successfully developed a simple and minimalistic landing page to welcome users to the project. In the coming months, I plan to integrate a robust relational database using either **SQLAce** or **Firebase Auth** to enhance the program's data handling capabilities. I'm super excited to integrate my agent-based modeling script with some attachment to network-adjacent Networkx metrics to learn about how my agents possibly could be handled better in a `simulated` environment!! I'm super new to all of this so I'm excited to get right in to the process.

Also, contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help improve this project, comment on any issues, feel free to open a pull request or reach out.
