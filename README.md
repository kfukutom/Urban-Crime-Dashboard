# Orientation & Onboarding

This project is my journey in learning **React Native**, **HTML/CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a strong focus on creating an intuitive and efficient user experience. Key goals of this project include:

- Establishing a clear **Design Hierarchy** for intuitive navigation
- Enhancing **User Interface (UI) Experience** for seamless interaction
- Deploying a productive **Agent-Based Model** to simulate a New York City borough environment
- Blend passion for products that connect tangible and intangible, digital spaces.
- Learn **D3.js**, along with implementing a MaplyAPI powered map.
- Master **React/React Native/Tailwind CSS** and become proficient in front-end development.

## Progress Updates

**Date**: 10/29/24

As of **October 29, 2024**, I have successfully developed a simple and minimalistic landing page to welcome users to the project. In the coming months, I plan to integrate a robust relational database using either **SQLAce** or **Firebase Auth** to enhance the program's data handling capabilities. I'm super excited to integrate my agent-based modeling script with some attachment to network-adjacent Networkx metrics to learn about how my agents possibly could be handled better in a `simulated` environment!! I'm super new to all of this so I'm excited to get right in to the process.

**Date** 10/30+31/24 ~ While preparing for my Discrete Math exam, I discovered a solution to improve the light-toggle functionality. Gained valuable insights into React's DOM client handling. About to start work on the log-in portal for the free demo ðŸ’ª As of now, I'm planning on doing a simple login interface, utilizing NextAuth, Prisma, MongoDB, and for the front-end, I'll be using some neat TaildwindCSS to try that out!
