# Project Overview

This project is my journey in learning **React Native**, **HTML/CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a strong focus on creating an intuitive and efficient user experience. Key goals of this project include:

- Establishing a clear **Design Hierarchy** for intuitive navigation
- Enhancing **User Interface (UI) Experience** for seamless interaction
- Deploying a productive **Agent-Based Model** to simulate a crime-related environment
- Blend passion for products that connect tangible and intangible, digital spaces.
- Learn D3.js / front-end stuff

## Current Progress

As of **October 29, 2024**, I have successfully developed a simple and minimalistic landing page to welcome users to the project. In the coming months, I plan to integrate a robust relational database using either **SQLAce** or **Firebase Auth** to enhance the program's data handling capabilities.
